/**
 * A theoretical graph for testing purposes.
 * All nodes are anonymous resources. All edges are labelled
 * rdf:value.
 * The basic HyperCube consists of the nodes being the
 * corners of a hypercube (e.g. in 3D a cube)
 * with the statements being the edges of the cube, in both 
 * directions. The labels are not present in the model.
 * This basic graph is then extended, for test purposes
 * by duplicating a node. Or by adding/deleting an edge between 
 * two nodes.
