Androjena is an Android port of Hewlett-Packard's Jena Semantic Framework (see http://jena.sourceforge.net).

Androjena is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
A copy of the License is shipped with this distribution in licenses/apache_software_license_2.0.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Androjena is based on Hewlett-Packard's Jena library version 2.6.2
A copy of Jena's copyright notice and full license are shipped with this distribution in 
licenses/jena_2.6.2_license.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Androjena ships with or contains code from several libraries. A list follows with library names and 
location of respective licenses/copyright notices copies inside this distribution:

IBM ICU4J 3.4.4: licenses/icu_1.8.1_and_later_license.htm
Jena IRI 0.8: licenses/jena_2.6.2_license.txt
Apache Xerces: licenses/apache_software_license_2.0.txt
GNU Classpath: licenses/gpl-3.0.txt
Quality Open Software's SLF4J-android 1.6.1: licenses/slf4j_android_1.6.1_license.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use: (in Eclipse)
1.	Create a new Android Project, or open an existing one
2.	Copy the androjena_version.jar file and all the jar files contained in the lib folder of this distribution 
	into a folder inside your project (usually defaults to lib)
3.	Right-click on the project name, choose Build path -> Configure build path
4.	Under the Libraries tab, click the Add Jar button, and choose the copied jars. Click Ok, Ok.
5.	Now, Androjena and the libraries it depends on (ICU4J, IRI and SLF4J-Android) can be 
	referenced inside your project, and will be included in the compiled Android APK package during build.

Please don't freak out if your project's build time will be considerably longer than before: Android uses 
the dx tool to extract the class files from Androjena jars and convert them to Dalvik bytecode format, 
and finally packages them, as long as your project's code, inside a classes.dex files. This translation 
process takes long, and is unavoidable by now (maybe the next releases of Android SDK Tools will be faster 
or will implement some sort of caching). If you want to speed up your code writing at least, please disable
the Build Automatically option under the Project menu.
