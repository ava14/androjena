     * It is unclear to jjc, whether we are obliged to copy the characters, or
     * whether we know that they will not be overwritten after we return. For
     * safety, I hence copy them. Normally, we have two interesting cases: a)
     * characters is called once, then endElement, and we form a literal from
     * the characters. This involves creating a string, if we used a char[] then
     * we would have another char[] to char[] copy, which is one too many. Hence
     * we use a StringBuffer. b) <eg:prop> <eg:typedNode /> </eg:prop> with two
     * lots of characters both white. This case happens from within
     * InsidePropertyElementFrame, and the second lot of characters do not get
     * here.
